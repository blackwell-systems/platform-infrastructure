"""
Composed Stack Examples - CMS + E-commerce Combinations

Demonstrates how different CMS and E-commerce providers can be composed together
using the event-driven integration architecture. Each example shows popular
combinations that serve different market segments and business needs.

KEY BENEFITS OF COMPOSITION:
- Choose best CMS for content needs + best e-commerce for business model
- Unified event system coordinates content and commerce updates
- Single infrastructure stack with multiple specialized providers
- Cost optimization through provider-specific strengths
- Avoid vendor lock-in by mixing providers strategically

ARCHITECTURE PATTERN:
Both CMS and E-commerce providers publish events to the unified content system:
- CMS Events: content_updated, content_deleted, content_published
- E-commerce Events: product_updated, order_created, inventory_changed
- Unified Processing: Cross-provider content synchronization and workflow automation
