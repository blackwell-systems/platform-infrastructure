Complete Integration Example: Artisan Coffee Shop

This example demonstrates the complete event-driven composition architecture
in action, showing how a small artisan coffee shop can build a professional
e-commerce website with CMS and product management at a fraction of traditional costs.

BUSINESS SCENARIO:
"Bean & Brew Artisans" is a small coffee roastery that wants to:
- Sell their coffee beans online (Shopify Basic: $29/month)
- Maintain a blog about coffee culture (Sanity CMS: $15/month)
- Deploy to global CDN automatically (AWS: ~$5/month)
- Total monthly cost: ~$49/month vs $500-2000/month traditional agency solution

TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENT:
This system demonstrates how our event-driven architecture enables:
- 90%+ cost reduction compared to traditional solutions
- Professional continuous deployment for small businesses
- Seamless integration between any CMS and E-commerce provider
- Global scalability with enterprise-grade reliability
