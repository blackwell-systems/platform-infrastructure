# Platform Infrastructure Architecture Documentation

## Current Status Overview

| Component | Status | Documentation |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| **Event System Core** | ‚úÖ Production Ready | [Current Architecture](./current-event-system-architecture.md) |
| **CDK Stack Implementations** | ‚úÖ **Comprehensive & Complete** | [Implementation Analysis](./implementation-vs-documentation-analysis.md) |
| **Provider Integrations** | ‚úÖ **Complete Factory System** | [CRITICAL CORRECTION](./CRITICAL_CORRECTION_implementation_analysis.md) |
| **State Reconciliation** | ‚ùå Not Implemented | [Future Design](../../STATE_RECONCILER_DESIGN.md) |
| **Metadata Layer** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Simplified | [Gap Analysis](./implementation-vs-documentation-analysis.md) |

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL CORRECTION**: Previous analysis incorrectly concluded that stack implementations were missing. All major CDK stacks (TinaCMS, Shopify, Sanity) exist as comprehensive, production-ready implementations with 800-1000 lines each.

## Quick Reference

### What Works Now (Production Ready)
- **Complete CDK Stack Implementations:** TinaCMS (~1000 lines), Shopify Basic (~1000 lines), Sanity CMS (~800 lines)
- **Comprehensive Provider System:** Factory patterns, CMS/E-commerce providers, integration patterns
- **Dual Integration Modes:** Direct (webhook ‚Üí build) and Event-driven (webhook ‚Üí SNS ‚Üí unified content)
- **Webhook Processing:** HTTP API Gateway ‚Üí Lambda ‚Üí SNS ‚Üí Build Pipeline
- **Content Caching:** DynamoDB with TTL cleanup (24-48 hours)
- **Multi-Provider Support:** CMS and E-commerce webhook ingestion with provider-specific logic
- **Auto-Scaling:** Lambda functions handle variable load
- **Security:** API key authentication, secrets management, webhook signature verification
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch dashboards, analytics, cost estimation algorithms
- **Business Logic:** Client suitability scoring, cost calculations, SSG engine compatibility

### What's Missing (Documented but Not Implemented)
- **Build Batching:** All content changes trigger immediate builds
- **Provider Abstraction:** No unified adapter registry
- **Advanced Monitoring:** Basic CloudWatch metrics only
- **State Reconciliation:** No drift detection or auto-healing
- **Error Recovery:** Limited retry logic, no webhook replay

### Performance Characteristics
- **Webhook Response:** 200-500ms per event
- **Cache Queries:** <100ms DynamoDB operations
- **Build Trigger:** 1-3 seconds end-to-end
- **Throughput:** Handles moderate webhook volumes effectively

## Architecture Documents

### Accurate Current State
- üìã **[Current Event System Architecture](./current-event-system-architecture.md)** ‚Üê **START HERE**
  - Mermaid diagrams of actual implementation
  - Performance characteristics and limitations
  - Integration examples and monitoring setup

### Implementation Gap Analysis
- üìä **[Implementation vs Documentation Analysis](./implementation-vs-documentation-analysis.md)**
  - Document-by-document accuracy assessment
  - Missing features and technical debt
  - Business risk analysis and recommendations

### Future/Aspirational Designs
- üîÆ **[Event-Driven Composition Architecture](./event-driven-composition-architecture.md)** ‚ö†Ô∏è *Claims vs Reality*
  - Contains inaccurate "Phase 2 Complete" claims
  - Many described features not implemented
  - Useful as future roadmap, not current state

- üöÄ **[State Reconciler Design](../../STATE_RECONCILER_DESIGN.md)** ‚ö†Ô∏è *Future Specification*
  - Advanced state reconciliation features
  - Control Bus pattern and drift detection
  - 0-5% implementation status

## For Developers

### Getting Started
1. **Read:** [Current Event System Architecture](./current-event-system-architecture.md)
2. **Understand:** What's implemented in `shared/composition/integration_layer.py`
3. **Deploy:** Use existing CDK constructs for new client stacks
4. **Monitor:** CloudWatch dashboards for webhook processing

### Adding New Features
1. **Check:** [Implementation Analysis](./implementation-vs-documentation-analysis.md) for priority
2. **Plan:** Consider impact on existing webhook processing
3. **Test:** Validate against multiple provider types
4. **Document:** Update current architecture documentation

### Common Pitfalls
- ‚ùå Don't assume features exist based on old documentation
- ‚ùå Don't build provider-specific logic into core system
- ‚ùå Don't skip testing with actual webhook payloads
- ‚úÖ Do follow existing patterns in `integration_layer.py`
- ‚úÖ Do update architecture docs when adding features
- ‚úÖ Do consider scaling impact of new features

## For Product/Business Teams

### Current Capabilities
- **Multi-Provider Content Management:** CMS and E-commerce integration
- **Automated Deployment:** Content changes trigger site rebuilds
- **Performance Optimization:** Content caching and CDN distribution
- **Reliability:** Auto-scaling infrastructure with error handling

### Realistic Expectations
- **Build Time:** 2-5 minutes for typical site regeneration
- **Content Sync:** Near real-time (under 30 seconds end-to-end)
- **Scaling:** Handles 100s of webhooks per hour comfortably
- **Maintenance:** Requires minimal ongoing intervention

### Not Currently Supported
- **Instant Content Sync:** No sub-second content updates
- **Content Conflict Resolution:** No automated content merging
- **Advanced Analytics:** Basic monitoring only
- **Multi-Region Deployment:** Single region deployment currently

## Quick Architecture Overview

```
[CMS/E-commerce] ‚Üí [API Gateway] ‚Üí [Lambda] ‚Üí [SNS] ‚Üí [Build Pipeline]
                                      ‚Üì
                                 [DynamoDB Cache]
```

The system successfully processes webhook events from multiple providers, caches content efficiently, and triggers automated site builds. While it lacks some advanced features described in aspirational documentation, it provides a solid foundation for content-driven static sites.
