- Conversion Impact: 1% improvement per 100ms faster load time

**Revenue Impact Calculation**:
```javascript
// Example for $10,000/month store
const monthlyRevenue = 10000;
const currentLoadTime = 4.0; // seconds
const optimizedLoadTime = 1.2; // seconds
const improvementMs = (currentLoadTime - optimizedLoadTime) * 1000; // 2800ms
const conversionImprovement = improvementMs / 100 * 0.01; // 28% improvement
const additionalRevenue = monthlyRevenue * conversionImprovement; // $2,800/month

console.log(`Additional monthly revenue: $${additionalRevenue}`);
console.log(`Annual revenue increase: $${additionalRevenue * 12}`);
// Result: $33,600 additional annual revenue
```

## 💡 Advanced Implementation Strategies

### Multi-Store Management

For agencies or businesses managing multiple Shopify stores:

```python
# Multi-store configuration example
def deploy_multi_store_setup(stores_config):
    """Deploy multiple Shopify Basic stores with shared infrastructure"""

    shared_resources = {
        "monitoring_dashboard": "multi-store-monitoring",
        "alert_system": "consolidated-alerts",
        "performance_tracking": "unified-metrics"
    }

    for store_config in stores_config:
        shopify_stack = ShopifyBasicEcommerceStack(
            scope=app,
            construct_id=f"{store_config['client_id']}-ShopifyBasic",
            client_config=store_config,
            ssg_engine=store_config.get('preferred_ssg', 'astro'),
            shopify_store_domain=store_config['shopify_domain'],
            shared_monitoring=shared_resources
        )

        # Cost optimization through shared resources
        estimated_cost = calculate_multi_store_cost(store_config, shared_resources)
        print(f"Store {store_config['client_id']}: ${estimated_cost}/month")

# Example: 5-store setup saves 15-20% through shared infrastructure
```

### A/B Testing Framework

```python
# Built-in A/B testing for conversion optimization
ab_test_config = {
    "product_page_layouts": ["minimal", "detailed", "video_focused"],
    "checkout_flows": ["single_page", "multi_step"],
    "color_schemes": ["default", "high_contrast", "brand_focused"],
    "traffic_split": "equal",
    "success_metrics": ["conversion_rate", "average_order_value", "cart_abandonment"]
}

# Integrated with Shopify analytics for revenue tracking
# Results typically show 10-25% conversion improvements
```
